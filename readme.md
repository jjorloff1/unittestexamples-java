# Java Unit Test Examples

## Purpose

This project was created to provide some incredibly simple unit test examples that would serve as an introduction
to Test Driven Development (TDD), Behavior Driven Development (BDD), and mocking (with Mockito).

For basic TDD, BDD, and Unit Testing examples see:
* `./src/test/java/com/example/unittest/AdderImplTest.java`

For examples of mocking with Mockito see:
* `./src/test/java/com/example/unittest/AlphabetServiceTest.java`

## How to run the tests

To run the tests in this project, clone it to your workstation and run `mvn install` from the command line.

## Prerequisites
* Java 8 SDK/JDK (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* Maven 3 (http://maven.apache.org/)
    * If you have a package manager such as Homebrew, you can run `brew install maven` from the command line.  This should automatically set your environment variables.
