# Java Unit Test Examples

This project was created to provide some incredibly simple unit test examples that would serve as an introduction
to Test Driven Development (TDD), Behavior Driven Development (BDD), and mocking (with Mockito).

For basic TDD, BDD, and Unit Testing examples see:
* `./src/test/java/com/example/unittest/AdderImplTest.java`

For examples of mocking with Mockito see:
* `./src/test/java/com/example/unittest/AlphabetServiceTest.java`
